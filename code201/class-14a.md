## CSS Transforms

With CSS3 came new ways to position and alter elements. Now general layout techniques can be revisited with alternative ways to size, position, and change elements. All of these new techniques are made possible by the transform property.

The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.

The actual syntax for the transform property is quite simple, including the transform property followed by the value. The value specifies the transform type followed by a specific amount inside parentheses.

`div {`
 ` -webkit-transform: scale(1.5);`
     `-moz-transform: scale(1.5);`
       `-o-transform: scale(1.5);`
          `transform: scale(1.5);`
`}`

The transform property includes multiple vendor prefixes to gain the best support across all browsers. The un-prefixed declaration comes last to overwrite the prefixed versions, should a browser fully support the transform property.

### 2D Transforms

Elements may be distorted, or transformed, on both a two-dimensional plane or a three-dimensional plane. Two-dimensional transforms work on the x and y axes, known as horizontal and vertical axes. Three-dimensional transforms work on both the x and y axes, as well as the z axis. These three-dimensional transforms help define not only the length and width of an element, but also the depth. We’ll start by discussing how to transform elements on a two-dimensional plane, and then work our way into three-dimensional transforms.

#### 2D Rotate

The transform property accepts a handful of different values. The rotate value provides the ability to rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees. Using a positive value will rotate an element clockwise, and using a negative value will rotate the element counterclockwise. The default point of rotation is the center of the element, 50% 50%, both horizontally and vertically.

#### 2D Scale

Using the scale value within the transform property allows you to change the appeared size of an element. The default scale value is 1, therefore any value between .99 and .01 makes an element appear smaller while any value greater than or equal to 1.01 makes an element appear larger.

#### 2D Translate

The translate value works a bit like that of relative positioning, pushing and pulling an element in different directions without interrupting the normal flow of the document. Using the translateX value will change the position of an element on the horizontal axis while using the translateY value will change the position of an element on the vertical axis.

As with the scale value, to set both the x and y axis values at once, use the translate value and declare the x axis value first, followed by a comma, and then the y axis value.

The distance values used within the translate value may be any general length measurement, most commonly pixels or percentages. Positive values will push an element down and to the right of its default position while negative values will pull an element up and to the left of its default position.

#### 2D Skew

The last transform value in the group, skew, is used to distort elements on the horizontal axis, vertical axis, or both. The syntax is very similar to that of the scale and translate values. Using the skewX value distorts an element on the horizontal axis while the skewY value distorts an element on the vertical axis. To distort an element on both axes the skew value is used, declaring the x axis value first, followed by a comma, and then the y axis value.%p

The distance calculation of the skew value is measured in units of degrees. Length measurements, such as pixels or percentages, do not apply here.

### Combining Transformations

It is common for multiple transforms to be used at once, rotating and scaling the size of an element at the same time for example. In this event multiple transforms can be combined together. To combine transforms, list the transform values within the transform property one after the other without the use of commas.

Using multiple transform declarations will not work, as each declaration will overwrite the one above it. The behavior in that case would be the same as if you were to set the height of an element numerous times.

*HTML*
`<figure class="box-1">Box 1</figure>`
`<figure class="box-2">Box 2</figure>`

*CSS*
`.box-1 {`
  `transform: rotate(25deg) scale(.75);`
`}`
`.box-2 {`
  `transform: skew(10deg, 20deg) translateX(20px);`
`}`






## CSS Transitions & Animations

One evolution with CSS3 was the ability to write behaviors for transitions and animations. Front end developers have been asking for the ability to design these interactions within HTML and CSS, without the use of JavaScript or Flash, for years. Now their wish has come true.

With CSS3 transitions you have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.

Animations within CSS3 allow the appearance and behavior of an element to be altered in multiple keyframes. Transitions provide a change from one state to another, while animations can set multiple points of transition upon different keyframes.

### Transitions

As mentioned, for a transition to take place, an element must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state. The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the `:hover`, `:focus`, `:active`, and `:target` pseudo-classes.

There are four transition related properties in total, including `transition-property`, `transition-duration`, `transition-timing-function`, and `transition-delay`. Not all of these are required to build a transition, with the first three are the most popular.

### Animations

Transitions do a great job of building out visual interactions from one state to another, and are perfect for these kinds of single state changes. However, when more control is required, transitions need to have multiple states. In return, this is where animations pick up where transitions leave off.

Animations  provide the ability to further customize an element’s behavior, including the ability to declare the number of times an animation runs, as well as the direction in which an animation completes.

Fortunately animations, just like transitions, can be written out in a shorthand format. This is accomplished with one animation property, rather than multiple declarations. The order of values within the animation property should be `animation-name`, `animation-duration`, `animation-timing-function`, `animation-delay`, `animation-iteration-count`, `animation-direction`, `animation-fill-mode`, and `lastly animation-play-state`.
