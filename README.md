## What Growth Mindset Means To Me
*Growth Mindset* in my opinion  is the concept of being constanly ready and embracing challenges whether in a paticular task or at life itself. It's accepting the fact that excelling at something as being capable and having the mindset of solving problems as opposed to lack of challenges. 

It's learning from our failures and using them as valuable building blocks to implement corrective analysis.
### Some tips to help with Growth Mindset
- Remember to breathe if your're feeling stressed or frustrated.
- Be aware of your emotional changes, being aware is the first step to changing your attitude.
- Remeber that obsatcles are meant to be tackled, so the feeling of impatience is only a temporary part of the process.
- Learn from everything. :smiley:
