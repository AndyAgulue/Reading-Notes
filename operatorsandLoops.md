*==*: Is equal to. This operator compares two values to see if they are the same.

*===*: Strict equal value. Does the same as "is equal to" plus checks the datatype as well as the value. it is the preferred method.

*!=*: Is not equal to. Compares two values to see if they are not the same.

*!==*: Strict not equal to. Same as "Is not equal to" in addition to checking datatype and is the preferred method.

*>*: Greater than: Checks if the number on the left is greater than the number on the right.

*>=*: Greater than or equal to: Checks if the number on the lefy is greater than or equal to the number on the right.
