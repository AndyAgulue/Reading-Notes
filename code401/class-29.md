# Graphs

A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices potentially connected by line segments named edges.

Vertex: A vertex is also called a node, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.

Edge: An edge is a connection between two nodes.

Neighbor: The neighbors of a node are it's adjacent nodes. They are connected via an edge.

Degree: The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.
