## JavaScript
 JavaScript is a programming language that adds the bells and whistles to a page, is is the client side language. It communicates with the browser using scripts.

 ### Scripts
  Are a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achive a specific goal.
  A browser may use different parts of the script depending on how the user interacts with the page. 
  Scripts can also run different sections of the code in respomse to the situations around them.

  **Writing a script**.
  To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task.

  -*Define the Goal*: First you should define the task you want to achieve. You can liken this steo to a puzzele for the computer to solve.

  -*Design the Script*: To design the script, you split the goal into a series of tasks that are going to be involved in solving this puzzle.
  you can write down individual steps that the computer need to follow to comple said task.

  _*Code Each Step*: Each step should be written in a language the browser can understand. In this case, JavaScript.
  
  ### Datatypes in JavaScript
  Datatypes are the classifications we give to the different kinds of data that we use in programming. There are 7 fundamental data types;

  .*Number*: Any number including numbers with decimals.

  .*Strings*: Any grouping of characters on your keyboard (letters, numbers, spaces , symbols e.t.c) surrounded by single quotes *''*.

  .*Boolean*: This type only has two possible values, TRUE or FALSE (without quotes). Think of them as ON/OFF switches.

  .*Null*: This datatype is denoted by the keyword **UNDEFINED** (without quotes). It also represents the absence of a value though it has a different use than NULL.  javascript.md




  ### Expressions 
  Expressions evaluate into a single value and rely opon *Operators* to calculate a vlaue. There are generally two types of expressions:
   
   *Expressions that just assign a value to a variable*; in order for a variable to be useful, it needs to be given a value, this is done using the assignment operator (=). Example "var color = 'green';". the value of the example is now green.

   *Expressions that use two or more values to return a single value*; You can perform operations on any number of individual values to determine a single value. Example " var age = 3 * 4;". The value of the age is now 12. This example also uses the assignment operator, so the result of the expression "3 * 4" is stored in the variable called "age".
