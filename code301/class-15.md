# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

The importance of diversity and  inclusion cannot be overstated. 

- Diverse teams are more creative.
- Diverse teams are more representative of society hence a products user base.
- Diversity makes the most sense as we live in a diverse world in every way you.

It's unfortunate that diversity is a conversation geared towrds a company's bottom line  or that tech companies are starting to have that conversation because of their bottom line, when intelligence or natural ability or adpetness is irrelevant to gender, skin tone or cultural background.

However, I'm glad the conversation is being had.

One thing to note, one of the articles mentioned that the decline of women in the tech industry corrolates with the introduction of personal computers, which was marketed to men, who were probably wealthy or upper-middleclass and so most likely white, in the 80's which shifted the educational field of computer engineering and hence the profesional field was shifted as well.
I wonder if anyone has studied the way these subjects are taught and the convention in which computer realted programmes are designed. It makes sense that the bias in the field has to be related to the way the subject matter is approached.
