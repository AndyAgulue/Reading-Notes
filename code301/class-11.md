# EJS

EJS stands for embedded JavaScript templates. And it is a templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with minimal code using JavaScript. It also helps embed JavaScript to HTML pages.

`A template is a tool that enables Frontend/Fullstack developers to write HTML markup. A template engine enables you to use static template files in your application. At runtime, the template engine replaces variables in a template file with actual values and transforms the template into the HTML file sent to the client.` - [Kishan Devaliya](https://www.codementor.io/@kishandevaliya/why-use-ejs-template-engine-with-expressjs-instead-of-handlebars-15tc0hiefq)
