JavaScript templating is an efficient way to render client side pages with JavaScript using JSON data source. The template is HTML markup, with added templating tags that will either insert variables or run programming logic.

`Mustache.render(“Hello, {``{name}}”, { name: “Andy” })`;

## Flexbox Chris Coyier <https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/>


Flexbox layout is an efficeient way to determine the layout and alignment of items in a container, even when their size is unkown or dynamic.

Flex layout gives the container the ability to alter it's items width/height abd order to best fill the available space. A flex container expands items to fill available free space or shrinks them to prevent overflow.
