# SQL

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a language that that allows users to access, modify and tranform data from a relational database. Because of it's simplicity, this language is used to provide secure and expandable storage for multitudes of websites and applications. This all helps us gather specific information about what kind of information databses contain.

## Relational Databases

Relational databases represent a collection of  data that is usually in a table form, similar  to a spreadsheet. These tables usually have information related to what the database represents.

Example: A weather database contains all information related to weather, like temprature, humidity, wind direction, atmospheric pressure and so on.
